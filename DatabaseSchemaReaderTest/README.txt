This test project is a Visual Studio 2008/2010 MsTest project.
You can easily convert it to NUnit:
- delete reference to Microsoft.VisualStudio.QualityTools.UnitTestFramework 
- add reference to NUnit.framework
- in properties, add the conditional compilation symbol NUNIT

These tests are INTEGRATION TESTS. They all interact with the database, IO and .net ADO data providers.
This means the databases must exist in order to run it.
*     SqlExpress with Northwind and AdventureWorks (integrated security)
*     Oracle Express with HR (userId HR, password HR)
         to enable HR in Oracle XE open sqlplus
        > ALTER USER hr ACCOUNT UNLOCK;
        > ALTER USER hr IDENTIFIED BY HR;

*     MySQL with Northwind (user id root, password mysql)
Plus additional databases
*     Postgresql with world
*     Firebird with Employee.Fdb
*     SQLite with Northwind (database file is C:\Data\Northwind.db)
*     SqlServer CE 4 with Northwind (database file is C:\Data\Northwind.sdf)
*     DB2 on localhost with standard Sample database (user db2admin, password db2)
*     Ingres on localhost with standard demodb database
*     Sybase ASA 15 on localhost with standard pubs3 database
*     Sybase ASE 12 on localhost with standard v12 demo database
*     Sybase UltraLite (v12) with standard custdb database, installed in default Windows 7 directory

All ADO providers are accessed using ADO 2's DbProviderFactories - there are no direct references.
If the provider is not installed (eg Devart.Oracle), the test runs as Inconclusive.
If the database cannot be opened (invalid connection string/ password etc), the test runs as Inconclusive.

The tests check the standard databases- HR for Oracle, Adventureworks for SqlServer, Northwind for others (there are some customized versions for MySQL- this uses a simple SqlServer conversion).

There are also tests using other ADO providers:
* Oracle's ODP (http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/topics/dotnet/index-085163.html), which is free. 
* Devart (http://www.devart.com/dotconnect/oracle/overview1.html) has free Oracle, SqlServer, MySql, PostgreSql and SQLite providers as well as licensed ones. I've tested both free and professional Oracle drivers; they are identical for this functionality.
* DataDirect (http://web.datadirect.com/products/net/index.html) has some trial providers
